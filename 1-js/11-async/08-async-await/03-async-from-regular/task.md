# Call async from non-async

We have a "regular" function called `f`. How can you call the `async` function `wait()` and use its result inside of `f`?

```js
async function wait() {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

  return 10;
}

function f() {
  // ...what should you write here?
  // we need to call async wait() and wait to get 10
  // remember, we can't use "await"
}
```

P.S. The task is technically very simple, but the question is quite common for developers new to async/await.
