# Olaylar: change, input, cut, copy, paste

<<<<<<< HEAD
Hadi veri güncellemelerine eşlik eden çeşitli olayları tartışalım.
=======
Let's cover various events that accompany data updates.

## Olay: change

<<<<<<< HEAD
[change olayı](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#event-input-change) öğe değişmeyi bitirdiğinde tetiklenir.
=======
The `change` event triggers when the element has finished changing.

Bu olay metin girişleri için odak kaybedildiği zaman meydana gelir.

Örneğin, aşağıdaki metin alanına birşey yazarken olay yok. Ama odağı başka bir yere taşıdığımızda, örneğin, butona tıkladığımızda bir `change` olayı olacak:

```html autorun height=40 run
<input type="text" onchange="alert(this.value)">
<input type="button" value="Button">
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
`select`, `input type=checkbox/radio` elementlerde ise olay, elementteki değişiklikten hemen sonra tetiklenir.
=======
For other elements: `select`, `input type=checkbox/radio` it triggers right after the selection changes:

```html autorun height=40 run
<select onchange="alert(this.value)">
  <option value="">Select something</option>
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="3">Option 3</option>
</select>
```

## Event: input

The `input` event triggers every time after a value is modified by the user.

Unlike keyboard events, it triggers on any value change, even those that does not involve keyboard actions: pasting with a mouse or using speech recognition to dictate the text.

For instance:

```html autorun height=40 run
<input type="text" id="input"> oninput: <span id="result"></span>
<script>
  input.oninput = function() {
    result.innerHTML = input.value;
  };
</script>
```

If we want to handle every modification of an `<input>` then this event is the best choice.

On the other hand, `input` event doesn't trigger on keyboard input and other actions that do not involve value change, e.g. pressing arrow keys `key:⇦` `key:⇨` while in the input.

```smart header="Can't prevent anything in `oninput`"
The `input` event occurs after the value is modified.

So we can't use `event.preventDefault()` there -- it's just too late, there would be no effect.
```

## Events: cut, copy, paste

These events occur on cutting/copying/pasting a value.

They belong to [ClipboardEvent](https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/#clipboard-event-interfaces) class and provide access to the data that is copied/pasted.

We also can use `event.preventDefault()` to abort the action, then nothing gets copied/pasted.

For instance, the code below prevents all such events and shows what we are trying to cut/copy/paste:

```html autorun height=40 run
<input type="text" id="input">
<script>
  input.oncut = input.oncopy = input.onpaste = function(event) {
    alert(event.type + ' - ' + event.clipboardData.getData('text/plain'));
    return false;
  };
</script>
```

Please note, that it's possible to copy/paste not just text, but everything. For instance, we can copy a file in the OS file manager, and paste it.

That's because `clipboardData` implements `DataTransfer` interface, commonly used for drag'n'drop and copy/pasting. It's bit beyond our scope now, but you can find its methods [in the specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dnd.html#the-datatransfer-interface).

```warn header="ClipboardAPI: user safety restrictions"
The clipboard is a "global" OS-level thing. So most browsers allow read/write access to the clipboard only in the scope of certain user actions for the safety, e.g. in `onclick` event handlers.

Also it's forbidden to generate "custom" clipboard events with `dispatchEvent` in all browsers except Firefox.
```

## Summary

Data change events:

| Event | Description | Specials |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `change`| A value was changed. | For text inputs triggers on focus loss. |
| `input` | For text inputs on every change. | Triggers immediately unlike `change`. |
| `cut/copy/paste` | Cut/copy/paste actions. | The action can be prevented. The `event.clipboardData` property gives read/write access to the clipboard. |
